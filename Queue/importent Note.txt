Circular and Liner Queue are same just few Things are change 
In liner index increment : i + +
In circuler index increment : (i+1) % total_size

***
(1): In both Queue the IsEmpty function is same ---
    int  isEmpty(Queue *p){
        return (p->back == p->front)?1:0;
    }
(2): In liner-Queue ~
        --front and back(or rare) initialize = -1;
    but in Circular-Queue ~
        --front and back(or rare) initialize = 0
